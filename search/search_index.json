Here we will post the latest news regarding our project and 5G Networks. Since the rollout of 5G Networks, a lot still need to be done, and many opportunities are available for research and development. Our main target is to provide a platform that will make it easier to learn, experiment and develop new solutions for 5G Networks.</p> <p>Our current focus are concentrated in tree main areas:</p> <ul> <li>5G Core Network</li> <li>5G Backhauling</li> <li>5G Management and Orchestration</li> </ul> <p>As you may now, 5G brought an entirely new architecture aiming the decouple the network functions and provide a more flexible and scalable network. This makes things a bit complicated to understand at first, but whenever you grasp the basics and the intention behind this new technology, you will see the opportunity to develop innovative solutions.</p> <p>Most important, we are collecting and development a set of tools that will help you learn and speed up the research and development of new 5G solutions. Along with the tools, we will publish detailed tutorials and provide you access to repositories and source-code to help you get started.</p> <p>To follow our latest advancements, tutorials announcements and other news. Stay tuned!</p>"},{"location":"towards-6g/6g-intro/","title":"Towards 6G","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2023/","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/announcements/","title":"Announcements","text":""}]}
