# Welcome to the Open6GNet Blog!

Welcome to our new Blog. Here we will post the latest news regarding our project and 5G Networks. Since the rollout of
5G Networks, a lot still need to be done, and many opportunities are available for research and development. Our main
target is to provide a platform that will make it easier to learn, experiment and develop new solutions for 5G Networks.

Our current focus are concentrated in tree main areas:

- 5G Core Network
- 5G Backhauling
- 5G Management and Orchestration

As you may now, 5G brought an entirely new architecture aiming the decouple the network functions and provide a more
flexible and scalable network. This makes things a bit complicated to understand at first, but whenever you grasp the
basics and the intention behind this new technology, you will see the opportunity to develop innovative solutions.

Most important, we are collecting and development a set of tools that will help you learn and speed up the research
and development of new 5G solutions. Along with the tools, we will publish detailed tutorials and provide you access
to repositories and source-code to help you get started.

To follow our latest advancements, tutorials announcements and other news. Stay tuned!
